    <h3>The Wind Rises</h3>
        <p>an experience that i'll never forget. it's taught the true meaning of love.
             i was truly inspired by Jiro's hard work and passion for creating wonderful planes,
              and his never ending determination.

    <h3>Ponyo</h3>
        <p>this movie is one of my favorites. it holds a special memory for me.
             i watched it with my ex back in 2022. we were talking a minute before a certain scene
             where ponyo dozes off happend. after it happend,
             i notice that my ex was quiet. i tried to talk to her since this happend over voice chat.
             i got no response then i realize that she was fast asleep.
